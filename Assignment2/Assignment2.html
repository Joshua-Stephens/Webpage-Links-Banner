        The streaming industry has had a huge impact on today’s society for a lot of different reasons. The first and biggest one is that 
        it’s opened up a whole new field for individuals to make more than just a living off doing various things that draws in people’s 
        attention from lets plays, reviewing products to even just building Lego. The second reason is that the bigger the streamer the 
        more influence they have which they use to endorse certain products that people wouldn’t even think of buying until they hear 
        that their favorite steamer uses it or recommends it. With this ever-expanding field many of these streamers have become 
        entrepreneurs by starting companies, making board games, and selling merchandise. So, in a nutshell the streaming industry is 
        more than just a hobby it’s a different way of making a living than just working a 9-5 job and it lets people do what they love 
        though it is a very competitive field because it can be hard to get noticed by the general public and even if they do get that 
        moment where they’re in the spot light if people don’t like the streamers personality they can easily fall back into the shadows.
        This webpage will show some of the bigger streamers that have used thier influence to become entrepreneurs.
